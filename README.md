# Final-Project

Project Name:
Caesar cipher decoding/ encoding

5 W-2:
Who - is my productâ€™s target audience? Every individual, who wants to encode/decode symbols, numbers, words, sentences or a whole text.
Why - does the audience need my product? To keep secrets (secret conversations, texts)
When - do I need it by? By the end of the semester
What - do I want to build? Encoding/ decoding program
How - do I build it (using what languages)? Python (OOP)

Overview:
Caesar cipher decoding/ encoding program will provide a space, where an individual can import a text, choose a number by which each letter will be shifted, run a program and get a decoded/encoded text. The result will be saved.

Target Users:
Who is your audience? An individual, who wants to encode/decode text.
What they can do with your product? Decoding/ Encoding
When they might use your product? If there is computer, even without Internet connection, as product available offline.
How they will access it? Using python program (open, run)


User Problems Solved:
1. User Need: People want to do decoding/encoding anytime, even when there is no Internet.
Resolution: This program will decode in offline mode.
2. User Need: People need to differentiate words, even when they're decoded.
Resolution: Program will put SPACE after every word.
3. User need: Not to overload computer.
Resolution: Program will save word, the shifting number and encoded/decoded word, then will return it, without doing work one more time.


User stories:
As active users of Caesar cipher decoding, we want to easily distinguish decoded words and decode/ encode even when we don't have access to the Internet. Moreover, we need to make difficult for others to read encoded/decoded texts, that is why we can choose the number by which the program will shift numbers/letters, symbols. As coding/decoding is a heavy work, we will save data and return it, if needed.
